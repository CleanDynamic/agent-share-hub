# The reconciliation series — handover diary

Contract: docs/reconciliation/CONTRACT.md. Read it, then the newest entry below.

## Deploy queue
1. Owed, needs direct access to the live project (RC-P03): delete the deployed edge functions seed-demo-data, seed-ecosystem, seed-new-posts and update-seed-data, then check that seed-demo-data answers 404 to an OPTIONS request (never GET or POST).

## RC-P00 — Set-up: skills check, contract, diary, baseline
Date: 2026-09-28 · Commits: SETUP-1 · Head: e2db7e50
Landed: docs/reconciliation/CONTRACT.md, this diary (47 prompt headings) and e2e/audit/rc-baseline.spec.ts (anonymous request counts on / and /gallery, backend stubbed).
Skills applied: ⟦neoscale-performance › Measure before you change anything⟧ ⟦neoscale-e2e-testing › Writing tests; Running and reporting⟧ ⟦neoscale-code-review › Review output format⟧ ⟦buildgallery-repo-map › 7⟧
Migrations queued: none
Lovable messages owed: none
Open: tsc PASS · unit tests 1981/1981 passed, 0 failed · build PASS · JS bytes 4292852 · largest chunk 3373934 index-DbkPwbmY.js · requests / 4, /gallery 3 · main was at e2db7e50; ex-door merged: yes · Playwright in a cloud container needs the uncommitted local config described in docs/connector/HANDOVER.md "EX-P16-fix" (Chromium /opt/pw-browsers/chromium, Vite on 127.0.0.1) · Head above is the commit this entry was written on; SETUP-1 sits on it.
Next: RC-P01

## RC-P01 — Clear reconnaissance (live results not supplied)
Date: 2026-09-28 · Commits: CLEAR-1 · Head: 90d7405e
Landed: docs/reconciliation/CLEAR-RECON.md. Q1–Q7 were never pasted and the owner said to continue, so every live value reads "not supplied"; the repo side is filled: 45 types.ts references to content_items in 39 tables, 19 with no index in migrations and 7 indexed only after another column, each "check live".
Skills applied: ⟦supabase-postgres-best-practices › references/schema-foreign-key-indexes.md⟧ ⟦buildgallery-repo-map › 4⟧ ⟦neoscale-code-review › Review output format⟧
Migrations queued: none
Lovable messages owed: RC-P01 results for Q1–Q7
Open: POSTS not supplied · FK_BLOCKING not supplied · SURVIVORS_OK not supplied (types.ts shows the dm_messages, dm_threads and builds references as nullable) · DEMO_ADMINS not supplied · rebuild_count in BUILD_COLUMNS_PRESENT not supplied (types.ts has it; the repo map's §4 note that it lacks it is out of date) · no live value exists until Q1–Q7 are pasted into CLEAR-RECON.md.
Next: RC-P02

## RC-P02 — 

## RC-P03 — Retire the four seeders (repository half, run ahead of RC-P02)
Date: 2026-09-28 · Commits: CLEAR-3, CLEAR-4 · Head: daf31d68
Landed: the four seed function folders and their two config.toml blocks are gone ([functions.mcp] byte-identical); /admin loses its two seed buttons; src/lib/rcGuards.test.ts fails if a seeder folder or a call to one comes back; docs/retired-surfaces.md records the deletion and its rollback.
Skills applied: ⟦neoscale-code-review › Automatic fail; Root cause, not symptom⟧ ⟦neoscale-error-monitoring › Privacy⟧ ⟦neoscale-e2e-testing › Writing tests⟧ ⟦buildgallery-repo-map › 3⟧
Migrations queued: none
Lovable messages owed: none. The live half, deleting the four deployed functions, is Deploy queue item 1 and waits for a session with direct access to the live project.
Open: run ahead of RC-P02 by owner decision, because this session had no live access (no SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN; the network policy denies api.supabase.com). CLEAR-2 stays reserved for RC-P02's backup. tsc PASS · unit tests 1983/1983, 0 new failures vs baseline · build PASS.
Next: RC-P04b; then RC-P02 and RC-P04 once live access exists
